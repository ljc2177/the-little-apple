(2) Food insecurity/low or mixed income neighborhoods - through the city's Black development grants, individuals from food insecure, and low and mixed income neighborhoods are encouraged to bring urban agriculture into their communities.

(2) Food insecurity/low or mixed income neighborhoods - through the city's Black development grants, individuals from food insecure, and low and mixed income neighborhoods are encouraged to bring urban agriculture into their communities.

(2) Food insecurity/low or mixed income neighborhoods - through the city's Black development grants, individuals from food insecure, and low and mixed income neighborhoods are encouraged to bring urban agriculture into their communities.

(2) Food insecurity/low or mixed income neighborhoods - through the city's Black development grants, individuals from food insecure, and low and mixed income neighborhoods are encouraged to bring urban agriculture into their communities.

In Portland, Maine the focus is primarily on community gardens, while in Washington, D.C the focus is primarily on urban farms.
